## 🍿 Overview

Watchy was built as a fun learning project and a personal solution to a common problem. As someone who loves watching different shows, I often found myself trying to remember movies I wanted to watch or jotting down show updates in my iPhone notes. So, I decided to create a "Trello Board for my watch list"—a simple yet effective way to keep everything in one place. And that's how Watchy was born!
